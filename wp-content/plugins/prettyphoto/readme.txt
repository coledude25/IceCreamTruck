An easy to use lightbox/thickbox clone for WordPress.

**WordPress prettyPhoto** is a jQuery lightbox clone. Not only does it support images, it also support for videos, flash, YouTube, iframes and ajax. Itâ€™s a full blown media lightbox.   

It is very easy to setup, yet very flexible if you want to customize it a bit. Plus the script is compatible in every major browser, even IE6.   
For a installation guide checkout the **Installation** tab above.

**Usage Guide:** It's very easy to implement. Just use a rel="prettyPhoto" attribute with the link tags you want to pop up and that's all. You're ready to rock.   

Example: `<a href="images.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto" title="This is the description"><img src="thumbnail.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="This is the title" /></a>`   
A set of short codes to use with visual editor of post/page is being cooked.
