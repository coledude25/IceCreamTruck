Implements Bootstrap 3 styles and components in WordPress through shortcodes.

== Description ==

###Just The Shortcodes, Please
Plenty of great WordPress plugins focus on providing or including the Bootstrap library into your site. **Bootstrap Shortcodes for WordPress** assumes you're working with a theme that already includes Bootstrap 3 and focuses on giving you a great set of shortcodes to use it with.

This plugin creates a simple, out of the way button just above the WordPress TinyMCE editor (next to the "Add Media" button) which pops up the plugin's documentation and shortcode examples for reference and handy "Insert Example" links to send the example shortcodes straight to the editor. There are no additional TinyMCE buttons to clutter up your screen, just great, easy to use shortcodes!

####Updated for Bootstrap 3.2
Now supporting the changes to Responsive Utilities introduced in Bootstrap 3.2!

== Changelog ==

= 3.2 =
* New Features
* This release features a brand new, much easier to use popup for the documentation. We're now using Bootstrap's "modal" component rather than the soon-to-be-retired WordPress Thickbox. We've also split the documentation up into tabs so that the technical information about the plugin isn't cluttering up the shortcode reference material. This should make the plugin a little less scary for end-users.
* Added optional "target" parameter to [list-group-item]
* Added support for new "block", "inline", and "inline-block" parameters in [responsive] introduced in Bootstrap 3.2
* Remove legacy [icon-white] shortcode (it wasn't documented anyway)
